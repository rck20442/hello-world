# hello-world
This is my first repository.  I am excited to learn all I can of the coding world.  

Hello, my name is Corey Kennedy.  My wife of 5 years and I live in NC.  I am currently working as a RN at Duke University Hospital.  
I am just now starting my journey into coding.  I hope to become a software engineer when all is said and done.  
I look forward to learning all I can about the coding world!
